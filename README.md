## Dependencies

- [Mitsuba-3](https://mitsuba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html): physics-based rendering engine to model radiance and geometric effects at off-nadir viewing angles.
- [pySMARTS](https://github.com/NREL/pySMARTS/tree/main/pySMARTS)   (Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine): to simulate incident solar spectral irradiance based on solar geometry, atmosphere, and surface characteristics.
- [PASEOS](https://github.com/aidotse/PASEOS): to simulate satellite orbits and propagate satellite positions using orbital elements (custom version to be released).

### Dataset
